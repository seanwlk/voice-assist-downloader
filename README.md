# Voice Assistant Downloader

Script for amateur bingers that allows you to request your Google Assistant (for now only that because I'm not sure if Siri or alexa have such integration with IFTTT) to download movies or the latest tv series episodes just with a voice command.
"Hey Google, download last week tonight" will for instance download the latest episode that aired in a specified lifespan in the config file.

## Requirements
- IFTTT account
- [OMDb API key](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
- Python >= 3.6
- transmission-cli / web (on a VPS/Raspberry/QNAP/Synology/ Generic nas with support)
- transmissionrpc python library
- Flask
- Knowledge on how to open and forward ports
- Time

## Configuration
Soon
